                     Founder of C-Tribe Festival & VP, Canadian Operations of AutonomIQ
Since completing his Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Alberta, where he spent five years as a shooting guard and Academic All-Canadian for the Golden Bears basketball team, Saffa has been an active player in the international start-up scene. As a doer, he has a curiosity for finding impactful intersections between commerce, technology, and culture.<br><br>
As a creative problem-solver, he is very proud of the work done to start the C-Tribe Festival — a community driven by diversity and helping innovative and creative people achieve their dreams. In less than 2 years the festival has grown to five days of innovative & creative programming, sixty speakers, 1000 attendees, and has exceeded $500k of measured, economic impact in 2018. He also works as the VP of Canadian Operations for a San Francisco Bay Area machine learning firm, AutonomIQ, that uses natural language processing, neural networks and search algorithms, and prediction algorithms to fundamentally alter the way software is developed, tested and maintained. In other words AutonomIQ builds robots to test new and exciting software. AutonomIQ currently employs a team of 25 and will be building
an additional research and development team of 30 additional people in Canada under Sahr’s leadership.
<br><br>
Mr. Saffa has worked as a international commercial model for more than twelve years
with stints in Toronto & New York, and has been featured by major brands &
publications that include the likes of Simons, Henry Singer, Kit and Ace, RBC, Forbes,
Cosmo Magazine, WatchIt!, Indochino, Travel Alberta, Hugo Boss & Gravity Pope.
<br><br>
He’s a serial entrepreneur and founder of multiple (failed) tech startups, including
Cappsule (a video recommendations app), and Crux AR (an augmented reality app).
Mr. Saffa sits on the board as the Chair of Communications of the Prairie Sky Urban
Gondola project that aims to add modern-day transportation infrastructure in the city of
Edmonton. He is currently also a board member of Digital Alberta that works towards
growing, supporting, and connecting the digital community. Mr. Saffa is also a Global
Shapers Alumni and Horasis Global Vision Community panelist.
<br><br>
Upon graduating university he grew and consulted with a digital marketing agency,
Nimbus Creative, for three years after completing his major in Business Law and
Economics and a minor in Marketing. In the Spring of 2020, he will be pursuing a
Masters in artificial intelligence research. Most proudly, Mr. Saffa is a stay at a home
son to two lovely parents and has an older sister he looks up to very much.
